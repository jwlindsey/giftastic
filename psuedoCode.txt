-make buttons on click
--populate buttons in the HTML with search bar content
---Before you can make any part of our site work, you need to create an array of strings, each one related to a topic that interests you. Save it to a variable called topics
---Try using a loop that appends a button for each string in the array.
-produce giphy images when populated buttons are clicked
---When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page
---When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.
---Under every gif, display its rating (PG, G, so on)

Add a form to your page takes the value from a user input box and adds it into your topics array. Then make a function call that takes each topic in the array remakes the buttons on the page.
